    """ Compute the presence ratio of a spike train.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_train_ms : numpy.ndarray
        Spike train in milliseconds.
    recording_length_ms : float
        Length of the recording in milliseconds.
    bin_duration_ms : float
        Duration of each bin in milliseconds.
        By default, this is set to 60 seconds.
    mean_fr_ratio_thresh : float
        Minimum mean firing rate ratio threshold.
        This is the minimum mean firing rate that must be present in a bin
        for the unit to be considered "present" in that bin.
        By default, this is set to 0.0. This means that the unit must have
        at least one spike in each bin to be considered "present."
    srate : float
        Sampling rate in Hz.

    Returns
    -------
    presence_ratio : dict
        Dictionary containing the presence ratio.

    Notes
    -----
    Presence ratio is not a standard metric in the field,
    but it's straightforward to calculate and is an easy way to
    identify incomplete units. It measures the fraction of time during a
    session in which a unit is spiking, and ranges from 0 to
    0.99 (an off-by-one error in the calculation ensures
    that it will never reach 1.0).
