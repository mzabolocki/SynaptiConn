def compute_isi_violations(spike_train_ms, recording_length_ms, isi_threshold_ms=1.5, min_isi_ms=0):
    """Compute the number of interspike interval (ISI) violations in a spike train.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_train_ms : numpy.ndarray
        Spike train in milliseconds.
    recording_length_ms : float
        Length of the recording in milliseconds.
    isi_threshold_ms : float
        Minimum interspike interval in milliseconds.
        This is the minimum time that must elapse between two spikes.
        By default, this is set to 1.5 ms, which is the refractory period of most neurons.
    min_isi_ms : float
        Minimum possible interspike interval in milliseconds.
        This is the artifical refractory period enforced by the
        recording system or the spike sorting algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    **TO DO** ++ explain the added calculations and the potential biases?
