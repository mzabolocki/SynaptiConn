    """ Calculate the jittered cross-correlogram and confidence intervals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre_spike_train : np.ndarray
        The spike times for the pre-synaptic cell.
    post_spike_train : np.ndarray
        The spike times for the post-synaptic cell.
    num_iterations : int
        The number of jittered cross-correlograms to compute.
        Default is 1000.
    max_lag_ms : float
        The maximum lag to compute the cross-correlogram (in milliseconds).
        Default is 25 ms.
    bin_size_ms : float, optional
        The size of each bin in the cross-correlogram (in milliseconds).
        Default is 0.5 ms.

    Returns
    -------
    ccg_bins : np.ndarray
        The bin edges for the cross-correlogram.
    ccg_counts : np.ndarray
        The counts for the actual cross-correlogram.
    jittered_ccgs : np.ndarray
        The counts for the jittered cross-correlograms.

    CCG notes
    ---------
    In CCG analysis, if one unit fires before the other, the peak of the CCG will be positive.
    This peak will be centred around the zero-lag time. This delay is typically 1-5 ms for excitatory
    synapses, but can vary depending on the type of synapse and the distance between the cells.
    True monosynaptic connections will have a peak at zero lag.

    If the time-lag is less than zero, this indicates that the post-synaptic cell is
    firing before the pre-synaptic cell. In such cases, the direction of causality could be reversed,
    and change depending on which cell is considered the pre-synaptic cell. This is why it is
    important to consider the direction of causality when interpreting the CCG results. This bidirectional
    can help confirm the presence of a monosynaptic connections.

    Module notes
    ------------
    A single spike train is jittered across multiple iterations to generate
    a distribution of jittered cross-correlograms. This process is repeated
    across a number of iterations to estimate the confidence intervals [1].
    This is introduced to test for the statistical significance of the actual
    cross-correlogram [1].

    It is recommended that the number of iterations be at least 1000 to
    obtain a reliable estimate of the confidence intervals [1].

    The jitter range is recommended to be within a 10 ms range [1].
