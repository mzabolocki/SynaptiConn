    """ Calculate the synaptic strength between two spike trains.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre_spike_train : np.ndarray
        The spike times for the pre-synaptic cell.
    post_spike_train : np.ndarray
        The spike times for the post-synaptic cell.
    jitter_range_ms : float
        Jin the range (in milliseconds) within which to jitter each spike time.
        Each spike will be shifted by a random amount in the range [-jitter_range_ms, +jitter_range_ms].
        Default is 10 ms.
    num_iterations : int
        The number of jittered cross-correlograms to compute.
        Default is 1000.
    max_lag_ms : float
        The maximum lag to compute the cross-correlogram (in milliseconds).
        Default is 25 ms.
    bin_size_ms : float, optional
        The size of each bin in the cross-correlogram (in milliseconds).
        Default is 0.5 ms.
    half_window_ms : float, optional
        The half-width of the window around the zero-lag time (in milliseconds).
        Default is 5 ms.

    Returns
    -------
    synaptic_strength_data : dict
        Dictionary containing the original cross-correlogram counts,
        the jittered cross-correlogram counts, the synaptic strength value,
        and the confidence intervals.

    CCG notes
    ---------
    In CCG analysis, if one unit fires before the other, the peak of the CCG
    will be positive. This peak will be centred around the zero-lag time.
    This delay is typically 1-5 ms for excitatory synapses, but can vary
    depending on the type of synapse and the distance between the cells.
    True monosynaptic connections will have a peak at zero lag.

    If the time-lag is less than zero, this indicates that the post-synaptic
    cell is firing before the pre-synaptic cell. In such cases, the direction
    of causality could be reversed, and change depending on which cell is
    considered the pre-synaptic cell. This is why it is important to consider
    the direction of causality when interpreting the CCG results.
    This bidirectional can help confirm the presence of a monosynaptic
    connections.

    Module notes
    ------------
    A single spike train is jittered across multiple iterations to generate
    a distribution of jittered cross-correlograms. This process is repeated
    across a number of iterations to estimate the confidence intervals [1].
    This is introduced to test for the statistical significance of the actual
    cross-correlogram [1].

    It is recommended that the number of iterations be at least 1000 to
    obtain a reliable estimate of the confidence intervals [1].

    The jitter range is recommended to be within a 10 ms range [1].
